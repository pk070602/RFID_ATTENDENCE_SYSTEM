# RFID_PROJECT
This is an IOT based RFID attendance system in which the names of the individuals are stored in their respective IDs (RFID cards). When the IDs are scanned by the RFID reader, the information is sent to the microcontroller (NodeMCU) which displays the information in a google spreadsheet. The google spreadsheet can be accessed by any system with authorized access.
